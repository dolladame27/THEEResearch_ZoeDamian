## Step 1: Formulate the Question:


```{r}
"What is the ideal population size and fraction of introduced fitter individuals regarding variable frequency dependence?"
```

If you have a given initial population that is declining, you want to introduce a given fraction of individuals with higher fitness that drives the population growth of the declining initial population to a increasing value. Although, The population underlies a negative density/frequency dependence, meaning that:

a)  more individuals introduced to the system leads to larger total population in a given and static environment, thus affect fitness of each individual, independent of initial fitness level and population growth negatively

b)  A smaller population increases fitness of each genotype and growth rate of population, but the fitness of overall population is lower in a larger fraction of individuals

-> meaning:

Parameters: - K: carrying capacity - initial Population Size: N_0 - fraction of introduced mutants: m_0/N_0

## Variables:
